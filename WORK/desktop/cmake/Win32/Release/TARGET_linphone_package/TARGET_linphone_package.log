  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
    By not providing "FindLinphone.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
    asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Linphone",
    but CMake did not find one.
  
    Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Linphone" with any
    of the following names:
  
      LinphoneConfig.cmake
      linphone-config.cmake
  
    Add the installation prefix of "Linphone" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
    "Linphone_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
    "Linphone" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
    been installed.
